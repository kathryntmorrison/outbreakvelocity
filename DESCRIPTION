Description: The package outbreakvelocity estimates front-wave velocity of an
    outbreaking or emerging infectious disease. As inputs, only spatial coordinates
    and dates of first case are required. Users specify the desired or maximum order
    of the linear model used to interpolate the timing of the disease across the
    geographic area, and that model is used to estimate the rate and direction of
    disease spread.
Depends:
    R (>= 3.1.3),
